### 1. Artifex Design Studio
A React Native drawing app designed with a clean, intuitive UI and powered by Skia. Features include multiple brushes, gesture controls, and tools inspired by design software. Optimized for smooth, responsive drawing, the app aims to provide an efficient and immersive art-making experience.

### 2. Sugoi Street Co.
My personal venture focusing on gym wear, anime gym wear, and stickers. This project is about merging my love for anime with fitness culture, bringing out products that speak to both worlds.

### 3. Kiri-1 [WIP]
Inspired by the NZXT AIO cooler, the idea behind this is to create a gauge pod that will be able to simulate a gif of your choosing.
